# 🖼️ Image Similarity Search
a Machine Learning model Built to Search for Similar or Identical Images. This Project was made in fulfillment with the Skills Union Data Science and AI Certification.
<br><br>
## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds a basic Image Search System that uses the K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to Search if an Image is similar to a list of other Images. It demonstrates core KNN preprocessing steps and classification techniques using Python's scikit-learn library.
<br><br>

## 🛠️ Features
- Extracting Image from Python's Image Library.
  
- Preprocessing to ensure accuracy.

- Image Search using K Nearest Neighbor.

- Model training and testing on Image dataset.

<br><br>

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

- scikit-learn

- PIL

- numpy
  
- matplotlib
<br><br>

## 🗂️ Dataset
3 Images extracted from PIL, an image of an astronaut, cup of coffee, and a cat.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/NoorNick/Image-Similarity-Search
cd Image-Similarity-Search
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br><br>

## ▶️ How to Run
Run the notebook or script to train the spam classifier and test it:

```
python Image_similarity_search.py
```
